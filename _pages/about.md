I am a PhD candidate at Harvard University in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, working with Zhiming Kuang. My research focuses on using computational techniques to improve subseasonal weather forecasts. I did my undergraduate at MIT, where I majored in Atmospheric Science and Physics. 

Read more about my research interests on the Research tab, download my papers on the Publications tab, and peruse my list of recommended climate and atmospheric science books on the Readings tab. Much of my code is freely available on my [github](https://github.com/sweidy). Feel free to email me at sweidman at g dot harvard dot edu.
